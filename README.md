# Local LLM Hub

A tiny local HTTP hub that routes `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic shape) and
`POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI shape) to several backends by `model` name,
plus a local whisper.cpp ASR pair and a text-to-speech pair, both reachable
through the hub's `/v1/audio/*` proxy (observable) or directly on their own
ports. Audio runs both directions: speech→text via `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
and text→speech via `/v1/audio/speech`. Image **generation** is available
OpenAI-shape at `POST /v1/images/generations` (Google Imagen via the
Antigravity CLI).

## Active rotation

Subscription-backed cloud routes (no GPU, no API keys, no Cloud project):

- **`claude-*`** — forwarded to the **`claude -p`** CLI on your machine,
  using your local Claude Code auth (your subscription) instead of an
  API key. Four rows: `claude-haiku-4-5` (alias `claude_haiku`),
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` (`claude_sonnet`), `claude-opus-4-8`
  (`claude_opus`), `claude-fable-5` (`claude_fable`). The short aliases
  are version-free, so when a new Claude release lands only the row's
  `display_name` needs updating and downstream callers keep working
  unchanged.
- **`gemini-*`** — forwarded to the **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`), using
  your Google sign-in (no API key required). Three rows: `Gemini 3.1
  Pro (High)` (alias `gemini_pro`), `Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)` (alias
  `gemini_flash`), `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)` (alias `gemini_lite`).
  `agy` replaces the standalone `gemini` CLI, which Google deprecates
  for AI Pro / Ultra subscribers on 2026-06-18. `agy` has no per-call
  model flag, so the hub switches its globally-selected model through
  the `/model` picker before each request — see
  [src/gemini_cli.py](src/gemini_cli.py). Quotas follow your Google
  AI Pro / Ultra plan.
- **`gemini_image`** — image **generation** via `agy`'s built-in Google
  **Imagen** tool, exposed OpenAI-shape at `POST /v1/images/generations`
  (returns `data[].b64_json`). `agy` ships no Nano Banana picker model;
  Imagen is its only image backend, hosted inside a Flash text session.
  The hub captures the generated artifact and returns it; the call lands
  in the observability ring like other traffic. Editing is also available
  (`POST /v1/images/edits`, multipart image+prompt) but is slow and
  procedural — see [docs/image-generation.md](docs/image-generation.md).
  Both are testable from the admin Playground's image card.

Local entries in active use as of the May 2026 frontier reading:

- **`qwen3.5-4b`** — local `llama-server` running
  [unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF)
  on `127.0.0.1:8088` (4 B hybrid Gated DeltaNet + sparse MoE, full
  GPU offload, Apache 2.0, 262 k native context). Fills the
  `agentic_light` role: OpenClaw fast lane, classification, edge.
  Also addressable as `model="agentic_light"` — clients that hit the
  role alias survive future `/swap-model` rotations unchanged.
  A **virtual no-think alias** `qwen3.5-4b-nothink` (role alias
  `agentic_light_nothink`) shares this same `:8088` backend — no second
  process, no extra VRAM — and makes the hub inject
  `chat_template_kwargs={enable_thinking:false}` into every request, so
  clients that can't send that field themselves (e.g. Home Assistant's
  `extended_openai_conversation`) still reach Qwen's fast, no-reasoning
  path. Plain `qwen3.5-4b` / `agentic_light` stay thinking-capable; a
  caller that sends its own `chat_template_kwargs` always wins.
- **`gemma4-26b-a4b-it`** — local `llama-server` running
  [unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF)
  on `127.0.0.1:8087` (25 B / 3.8 B-active MoE, IQ4_XS i-matrix quant
  — whole model on GPU in 16 GB VRAM). Fills the `agentic_heavy` role:
  deep agentic, transcript polishing, document work, EN↔ES↔CA. Also
  addressable as `model="agentic_heavy"` for the same reason.
- **`whisper-large-v3-turbo`** — local `whisper-server`
  ([ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp))
  running [ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)
  on `127.0.0.1:8090`. OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions`.
  POST either to the hub's proxy at `:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions`
  (captured in the observability ring) or directly to `:8090` for lower
  overhead. Port 8090 is a shared mutual-exclusion lock with
  `E:\automation\automation\audio\transcribe_voice`. Fills the
  `audio_transcribe` role.
- **`whisper-medium-translate`** — sibling whisper-server on
  `127.0.0.1:8091` running `ggml-medium.bin` on CPU. Same
  OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` shape; supports
  `task=translate` (turbo is transcription-only — its decoder distill
  drops translation). Eager-loaded (~1.5 GB RAM, always ready). Fills
  the `audio_translate` role. A lazy-load mode is also available — see
  [src/whisper_translate_proxy.py](src/whisper_translate_proxy.py) — for
  hosts that need to reclaim RAM when translate is rare.
- **`whisper-vanilla`** — the same `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin` as the turbo
  row, configured for **unbiased language auto-detection**. The escape
  hatch for callers transcribing general multilingual audio (e.g. Spanish
  voice notes) that the English tech-dictation glossary would otherwise
  force-Englishize. Select it with `model="whisper-vanilla"` on the
  standard `:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions` request — no `language` needed.
  Two things make detection unbiased, **both required** (proven in #128):
  it carries **no** dictation glossary (`--carry-initial-prompt`/`--prompt`
  bias detection toward English), **and** the lazy proxy injects
  `language=auto` into every request that omits one — because
  whisper-server otherwise forces `language=en` per request regardless of
  its launch-level `--language` flag, so dropping the glossary alone is not
  enough. A caller that sends its own `language` always wins. Lazy-loaded
  (spawn-on-request via
  [src/whisper_translate_proxy.py](src/whisper_translate_proxy.py),
  idle-unload after 300 s) on external `:8094` / loopback `:18094` so it
  costs no VRAM when idle. See issue #128.
- **`piper-tts`** — fast local text-to-speech (the inverse of whisper),
  served by the in-repo FastAPI shim [src/tts_server.py](src/tts_server.py)
  on `127.0.0.1:8096`. OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/speech`. POST to
  the hub's proxy at `:8000/v1/audio/speech` with `model="audio_speech"`
  (captured in the observability ring). Uses the standalone Piper binary plus
  ONNX voices in `models/piper/`; default voice is `amy`
  (`en_US-amy-medium`; `ryan`, `ryan-high`, `lessac` remain selectable).
  `piper.exe` runs **resident** (one process per
  voice+speed, ONNX voice loaded once and reused) so short phrases skip the
  per-request model-load tax: integrated latency for `Arming the perimeter.`
  is ~0.06 s direct to `:8096` and ~0.06 s through the hub (warm, connection
  reused; #163). Fills the `audio_speech` role and is auto-loaded by the tray.
- **`orpheus-tts`** — expressive local text-to-speech, served
  by the in-repo FastAPI shim [src/tts_server.py](src/tts_server.py) on
  `127.0.0.1:8093`. OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/speech`. POST to the
  hub's proxy at `:8000/v1/audio/speech` (captured in the observability ring)
  or directly to `:8093` for lower overhead. Orpheus-3B is LLM-based, the
  most natural/expressive local voice and faster than real-time on GPU; its
  reference runtime (vLLM) has no usable Windows build, so the shim runs the
  GGUF on the vendored `llama-server` (loopback `:18093`) and decodes its
  audio tokens with the SNAC codec in-process. Address explicitly as
  `model="orpheus-tts"` when expressiveness matters more than latency.
- **`kokoro-tts`** — low-footprint Kokoro-82M TTS on `127.0.0.1:8095`, served
  by the same [src/tts_server.py](src/tts_server.py) OpenAI-compatible
  `/v1/audio/speech` shim. It uses `kokoro-onnx` with the int8 ONNX model and
  packed voice styles in `models/kokoro/`. Start it from the Models tab or
  `launchers/run_tts_kokoro.bat`, then call the hub with `model="kokoro-tts"`.
  Default voice is `am_michael`, chosen as the closest built-in starting point
  for a Jarvis-like assistant voice. Spanish is available explicitly as
  `ef_dora` (female) or `em_alex` (male); those profiles select Spanish
  phonemization rather than the English default. ONNX Runtime CUDA is used when available,
  but the current Windows path measures roughly 2.2 s direct / 2.5 s through
  the hub for a short phrase, so it is kept as an option rather than the
  `audio_speech` role default until you intentionally repoint that role.
- **`chatterbox-tts`** — second TTS engine on `127.0.0.1:8092`, **on demand**
  (not autostarted). Resemble AI's Chatterbox (~0.5 B, torch) with an
  emotion/"tone" dial (`exaggeration` + `cfg_weight`) and optional zero-shot
  voice cloning. Start it from the Models tab or
  `launchers/run_tts_chatterbox.bat`. See
  [docs/add-tts.md](docs/add-tts.md) for the engine choice, request shape,
  and the Orpheus GGUF caveat.

**Transcription glossary.** Requests that go through the hub's audio
proxy (`:8000/v1/audio/*`) get a deterministic post-processing pass that
fixes persistent domain-term misspellings (e.g. "cloud code" → "Claude
Code"). The rules live in [config/transcription_glossary.json](config/transcription_glossary.json)
— an ordered list of literal `{"from","to"}` replacements
(case-insensitive, word-boundary, longest-phrase-first) plus a
`boost_terms` vocabulary. Edit it from the **📖 button on any whisper row
in the Models tab** (an inline editor; replacement edits apply without a
restart, boost-term edits on the next whisper start), or hand-edit the
JSON. **✨ Suggest from transcripts** mines the last *N* days of real
dictation from voice-transcriber's session API and proposes additions to
review. Direct hits to `:8090`/`:8091` bypass the glossary (and the
observability ring). See
[docs/whisper-asr.md](docs/whisper-asr.md) for the schema, the
in-app editor + miner, and the companion recognition-boosting mechanism.
NVIDIA Parakeet on Windows+CUDA (`parakeet.cpp`) was evaluated as a
*replacement* for this role and rejected — ~4× worse WER and no boosting
lever on this jargon-heavy workload. Parakeet running on the **Mac Mini's
Apple Neural Engine** (via FluidAudio/CoreML) is a different story: it's
enrolled as a selectable, non-default alternative — see
[Multi-host: the Mac Mini](#multi-host-the-mac-mini) below and
[docs/parakeet-asr-evaluation.md](docs/parakeet-asr-evaluation.md) for the
full trade-off writeup.

## Demoted candidates (kept defined, not in active rotation)

`glm-4.5-air` is **defined in `config/models.yaml`** but not in any
host's `enabled:` list anymore. Its launcher still exists
(`launchers/run_glm.bat`) for ad-hoc bring-up. Demoted on 2026-05-10 per
the May 2026 frontier reading — see
[docs/frontier-workflow.md](docs/frontier-workflow.md)
for the reasoning.

`qwen3.5-9b` was demoted the same day, but is **active again as of the
Mac Mini multi-host work** — it now runs on `mac-mini-m4` instead of
`tower` and is reachable through the Windows hub's own `base_url` like
any other model. See [Multi-host: the Mac Mini](#multi-host-the-mac-mini).

GLM **5.2** (the newer flagship) was evaluated for the local coding lane
and rejected — it is a single 744B-A40B MoE with no Air/Flash variant,
and even its smallest quant needs ~245 GB RAM+VRAM vs. this box's
~144 GB, so it does not load. Revisit if a GLM-5.2-Air/Flash ships; see
[docs/glm-5.2-evaluation.md](docs/glm-5.2-evaluation.md).

`gemma4-e4b-it` is the previous `agentic_light` role-holder, replaced
by `qwen3.5-4b` on 2026-05-10 via `/swap-model`. It is **kept in
`enabled:`** on the reference host for ad-hoc bring-up via
`launchers/run_gemma4_e4b.bat`, but no longer autostarted.

## Roles & bi-weekly refresh

The four active local roles live in `config/models.yaml` → `roles:`:

| Role | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `agentic_light` | `qwen35_4b` | OpenClaw fast lane / classify / edge |
| `agentic_heavy` | `gemma4_26b` | Deep agentic, transcripts, docs, ES↔EN↔CA |
| `audio_transcribe` | `whisper` | EN/ES audio → text |
| `audio_translate` | `whisper_translate` | ES audio → English (eager CPU sibling) |
| `audio_speech` | `piper` | text → speech (Piper fast default; Orpheus/Kokoro/Chatterbox on demand) |

Two Claude Code entry points drive the refresh:

- **`/frontier-refresh`** — the research skill
  (`.claude/skills/frontier-refresh/SKILL.md`, the single owner of the
  brief, cadence, and output contract). Regenerates
  `docs/frontier/runs/<today>/{report.md,frontier.json,frontier.html}`,
  repoints `LATEST`, and posts the per-role verdict as a comment on the
  always-open **frontier ledger issue
  [#272](https://github.com/ferraroroberto/local-llm-hub/issues/272)** —
  its last comment is always the current state. **Read-only on the
  registry** — produces artifacts only, never rewires anything. Runs
  unattended **bi-weekly** (the skill's `run-weekly.bat`, registered in
  app-launcher's Jobs tab weekly FRI 02:30, self-skipping alternate
  weeks) and on demand any time.
- **`/swap-model`** — interactive role swap. Reads the latest run +
  current roles, asks one question at a time (which role, which target,
  hf_repo if not registered, download now?), shows the planned diff,
  then edits `config/models.yaml` + writes a launcher pair + (optionally)
  shells out to `scripts/download_models.py`.

To browse a run interactively, open
`docs/frontier/runs/LATEST/frontier.html` in a browser — it's a
standalone interactive chart, no admin UI involved. To act on a run,
run `/swap-model` from Claude Code.

Side-by-side technical specs + docs links for all active models live in
[docs/model-comparison.md](docs/model-comparison.md). The latest research
brief and run sit under [docs/frontier/](docs/frontier/).

Point any client — the official `anthropic` or `openai` SDKs, openClaw,
a curl one-liner — at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and swap backends by
changing the `model` string. Claude requests bill your subscription;
local model requests never leave the machine.

Inspired by the `_call_claude` pattern in
`E:\automation\inspiration-system\src\enrichment.py`.

## Latest-only policy

This repo intentionally ships **one model per role**. When a newer
release in the same family covers the same use case on the reference
hardware (e.g. Gemma 4 superseding Gemma 3), the older entry is
removed — registry, launchers, weights, and docs all go. The current
lineup and what each model is for live in
[docs/model-comparison.md](docs/model-comparison.md). Older entries
survive only in `git log` for historical context.

**Exception — one model per role, not per family.** The whisper
backend has two slots — `whisper` (turbo, 8090, transcription) and
`whisper_translate` (medium, 8091, translation). Turbo is
distill-decoded and was *not* trained on the translate task, so we
keep medium in a sibling slot for the rare cases when translation is
needed. Medium runs eager on CPU (~1.5 GB RAM) so the first translate
call is instant. The single-slot rule still applies *per role* —
there is one transcription model and one translation model.

## Scope & usage policy

This is a **personal playground** for running your own experiments
against your own Claude Code and Google AI Pro subscriptions and your
own local GPU on devices you personally own. It is **not** a hosted
service, a multi-tenant proxy, or a way to share subscription access.

To stay clearly within Anthropic's and Google's terms, please use it
only as intended:

- ✅ **Do** use it locally to call Claude or Gemini from your own
  scripts, agents, and tools on devices you personally own.
- ✅ **Do** use it on a trusted LAN to reach your own second machine
  or VM (e.g. a local agent runtime).
- ✅ **Do** route non-cloud traffic to the local qwen/gemma backends
  as much as you like — those are your own weights on your own silicon.
- ❌ **Don't** share the endpoint with other people — for Claude or
  Gemini, that would be sharing subscription access, which neither
  Anthropic's [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms)
  nor Google's [Additional Terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai)
  allow.
- ❌ **Don't** port-forward it to the public internet or host it
  behind a domain.
- ❌ **Don't** build a product, commercial service, or large automated
  pipeline on top of the Claude or Gemini paths — for anything beyond
  personal experimentation use the paid Anthropic API or Vertex AI /
  Gemini API, which their respective usage policies and commercial
  terms are designed for.
- ❌ **Don't** hammer `claude -p` or the `agy` CLI in tight loops; keep
  volume at human-in-the-loop speeds so you don't abuse the service or
  get rate-limited. The Antigravity CLI quota follows your Google AI
  Pro / Ultra plan and is shared with the Antigravity IDE, so heavy hub
  use can also starve your IDE assistant. The local backends are
  rate-limited only by your GPU.

If your use case goes beyond "me, tinkering on my own machine,"
switch to the Anthropic API for Claude. When in doubt, check
[anthropic.com/legal](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/) or email
`support@anthropic.com`. This repo is provided as-is, with no
guarantee that it complies with Anthropic's terms for any particular
use.

mermaid diagrams (components, modules, request lifecycle),
[docs/whisper-asr.md](docs/whisper-asr.md) for the whisper ASR backend

[docs/add-tts.md](docs/add-tts.md) for the text-to-speech backend
(`/v1/audio/speech`).

## Multi-host: the Mac Mini

`local-llm-hub` runs as **one full install per machine**, but a model can
be *owned* by one host and made reachable through any other host's own
`base_url` — a client never needs to know or care which machine actually
runs a given model. Each `hosts:` entry in `config/models.yaml` gets an
`address:` (LAN IP), and each `models:` row gets an optional `host:` (which
host owns it — omitted means "whichever host resolves this config", i.e.
every existing single-host model is unaffected). A model listed in a
*non-owning* host's `enabled:` is transparently proxied: the request lands
on that hub exactly like any other, gets resolved, sees `host` doesn't
match the active machine, and is forwarded verbatim to the owning host's
own `:8000` (not its raw backend port) — so the proxied call still lands in
the owning hub's own observability ring. This is symmetric: the Mac Mini's
own hub can equally proxy to a Windows-owned model.

Today this powers the `mac-mini-m4` host (`192.168.0.14`, Apple M4):

- **`qwen3.5-9b`** — moved here from `tower` (see
  [Demoted candidates](#demoted-candidates-kept-defined-not-in-active-rotation)
  above); same `llama-server`, just running on the Mac.
- **`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`** — NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 on the Apple
  Neural Engine via [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)
  (CoreML), served by the vendored Swift worker in `mac/parakeet-worker/`
  + `src/parakeet_server.py`. A **selectable, non-default**
  `audio_transcribe` alternative (`model="parakeet"`) — faster than
  whisper-turbo but drops the "Claude Code" wake phrase and mangles
  "YOLO", so it's opt-in for latency-sensitive callers (e.g. Home
  Assistant voice commands) rather than the role default. Full
  measurement + trade-off writeup:
  [docs/parakeet-asr-evaluation.md](docs/parakeet-asr-evaluation.md).

The Windows hub's admin UI Services card shows a live Mac Mini reachability
pill alongside Docker/Langfuse. Cross-host auth reuses `extra_allowlist` in
`config/webapp_config.json` (per-machine, not committed) — each host's LAN
IP is allowlisted on the other, the same bypass the bearer-token middleware
already grants loopback callers.

### Mac Mini lifecycle: autostart, remote bootstrap, sync (#181)

The Mac Mini's hub has no tray-equivalent process supervisor — a
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ferraroroberto.local-llm-hub.plist`
LaunchAgent fills that role instead (`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`, installed
by `python -m src.install --fix` on the Mac itself — see
`mac/launchagent/`). A **deliberate** stop (`POST /admin/api/hub/stop`)
`launchctl bootout`s the job so it stays down; a restart
(`POST /admin/api/hub/restart`) uses `launchctl kickstart -k`. (macOS
detail worth knowing if you touch this: launchd respawns a job under
`KeepAlive` after *any* signal-terminated exit — a plain self-SIGTERM and
even `launchctl stop` both get relaunched — `bootout` is the only thing
that actually unloads it.)

For the case where the Mac's hub is fully dead (crashed before
`RunAtLoad` fires, or manually killed), Windows can bring it back over a
**dedicated, forced-command-restricted** SSH key
(`~/.ssh/local-llm-hub-remote-ctl`, path in `.env`'s
`LOCAL_LLM_HUB_SSH_KEY`) — the Mac's `authorized_keys` restricts that key
to `mac/bin/hub-remote-ctl.sh`, which only allows two verbs
(`bootstrap` / `sync`), no general shell. The Services card's Mac Mini row
gets a **Wake** button (visible when unreachable →
`POST /admin/api/hosts/mac-mini-m4/bootstrap`) and a **Sync** button
(visible when reachable → `.../sync`, which `git pull --ff-only`s the
Mac's checkout before restarting it). An **out-of-sync** badge appears on
the pill when the two hubs' `git_sha` (from `/admin/api/version`) differ —
`sync` is the fix.

When `mac_mini_sync` is `true` in **`config/startup_profile.json`** (see the
committed **[template](config/startup_profile.example.json)** — the live file
is gitignored, issue #304)
(the default — toggle it off from the Models tab's **Startup** card), the
Windows hub does this automatically on its own boot instead of waiting for
a manual click: bootstrap if the Mac Mini is unreachable, sync if it's
reachable but its `git_sha` doesn't match (issue #265). The Mac Mini's own
hub skips this self-probe when it resolves as the active host.

The Models tab tags every remote-owned tile with a small `on <host-id>`
badge (e.g. `qwen3.5-9b` / `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` both show `on
mac-mini-m4`) so a displayed PID is never mistaken for a local process.

### Machines console (#309)

The **Machines** tab turns the hub into a fleet machine console — one place
to see the health of every box and act on it. It reads the host inventory
from `config/models.yaml` `hosts:` (now enrolling two managed-only machines
alongside `tower` and `mac-mini-m4`: **OpenClaw**, a Linux laptop, and
**gaming**, a Ryzen Linux inference satellite — #323) and renders a card per machine:

Every reachable machine shows the **same** snapshot — CPU / RAM / GPU / disk
(as uniform horizontal gauges) + uptime:

- **This machine** reads it locally from `src/system_stats.py`.
- **Peers** are probed two ways, both independent of whether the hub runs
  there — the card answers *is the box on?*, not *is the hub up?*
  (`src/remote_stats.py`): a **hub-independent TCP liveness probe** for
  up/down, and the same CPU/RAM/GPU/disk/uptime snapshot collected over the
  hub user's **own** passwordless SSH (a read-only one-liner, per-OS). A node
  flagged `dormant` is shown but not live-probed (none at present). All peer actions —
  read-only observability *and* reboot/shutdown — go over that general SSH
  (plus TCP for liveness); the forced-command key is reserved for the Mac
  Mini's hub-lifecycle `bootstrap`/`sync` (#181).

**Reboot / shutdown (destructive, peers only).** Any peer with an SSH channel
(`address` + `ssh_user`) offers **Reboot** and **Shut down** actions; the
active hub host is always excluded (powering it off would take the console
down with it). These run over the hub
user's **own general SSH** (issue #311) — the same passwordless channel the
stats snapshot uses — as `ssh <user>@<host> "sudo -n /sbin/shutdown -r|-h
now"`, detached with `nohup` so the SSH command returns cleanly before the box
drops off. The only prerequisite is the peer's passwordless-sudo sudoers
drop-in (already in place on the Mac Mini and OpenClaw); **nothing has to be
deployed to a managed machine** — no per-peer key, no forced-command script.
This is why OpenClaw's power buttons work the moment it is reachable.

**Remote Desktop.** A per-machine **Remote Desktop** action serves a
generated `.rdp` launcher (built from the machine's configured `rdp`
`{address, user}` target) that the viewing device downloads and opens — no
web RDP client, no dependency on any out-of-repo launcher file.

**On-demand diagnostics (#315).** The *this machine* card carries a **🔬
Diagnostics** row — a state chip showing the last health verdict (or live
capture progress) that opens a drill-in dialog. From there you can take a
**one-shot snapshot** or run a **timed capture** (15 min → 8 h, sampling every
5–60 s) that records system CPU/RAM/swap/disk/net/GPU **plus a full per-process
inventory and the listening-port map** into `data/diagnostics.db`.

The point is interpretation, not just recording: processes are attributed to the
app that owns them (`app-launcher: 3 procs / 800 MB`, not `python.exe ×14`) via
the committed `config/diagnostics_apps.json`; a finished run gets a persisted
`healthy`/`warning`/`critical` verdict from the tunable thresholds in
`config/diagnostics_rules.json`; and any run can be marked a **baseline** so
later runs report drift ("+2 resident apps, +3.1 GB idle RAM, new listener
:8099"). Each run also records **what it could and couldn't measure** (#322):
where the hub lacks privilege — macOS denies socket enumeration and ~40% of
per-process memory/CPU — the report says "not collected" and the verdict reads
`HEALTHY · ⚠ partial coverage` rather than letting an unmeasured signal pass as a
clean bill of health. Deep analysis happens outside the UI — export a run as
JSON, download an LLM-ready markdown health report, or query the SQLite file
directly.

**It adds no resident process**: the sampler is an asyncio task inside the
already-running hub, so nothing exists when no capture is active. An **opt-in
daily snapshot** (default off) keeps multi-week trends alive without adding one
either. Pure `psutil` + stdlib `sqlite3`, so the identical capture runs on the
Mac Mini and OpenClaw.

**Hub-less machines are covered too (#316).** A box that runs no hub (`openclaw`,
a dormant `tower`) is measured with a **zero-install** path: `scripts/portable_capture.py`
is a standalone `psutil`-only sampler delivered over SSH — `ssh host "python3 -
--duration-s 3600" < scripts/portable_capture.py > out.json` — whose raw output
is replayed into this store with `python -m src.diagnostics.ingest out.json`
(also `POST /admin/api/diagnostics/ingest`). The portable script interprets
nothing; attribution, coverage, and the verdict all run centrally at ingest
against the *source* machine's OS, so an ingested `openclaw` run is
indistinguishable from a local one and editing the attribution config
re-attributes it with no change on the peer. Machines that run their own hub use
the native path; both converge on the same store. Full reference:
[docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md).

**In-browser SSH terminal.** The **Terminal** action opens an xterm SSH
session by **reusing app-launcher's session-host** (its loopback ConPTY/WS
engine) rather than rebuilding a PTY stack here. This needs a small
companion change in app-launcher to register an `ssh` agent
([app-launcher#558](https://github.com/ferraroroberto/app-launcher/issues/558));
until that lands the terminal degrades gracefully with an actionable
"unavailable" state. Everything on this tab rides the existing bearer-token /
loopback-bypass middleware — no new auth scheme; the access model stays
loopback / Tailscale only.

## Setup

One command does everything — deps, llama.cpp binary, GGUF downloads
for the models enabled for this host:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.install --fix
```

The installer reads [config/models.yaml](config/models.yaml), figures
out which host row you are (by `LOCAL_LLM_HUB_HOST` env var, else
hostname match, else `default: true`), and only downloads what that
host's `enabled` list asks for. On the reference Windows PC that's
the active rotation: Qwen 3.5 4B (~2.6 GB), Gemma 4 26B-A4B IQ4_XS
(~13.4 GB), whisper-large-v3-turbo (~1.62 GB), whisper-medium for
translate (~1.5 GB), plus Gemma 4 E4B (~5 GB) kept as the
agentic_light fallback, plus the llama.cpp + whisper.cpp CUDA
binaries under `vendor/`. On the Mac mini it's Qwen only.

The demoted candidates (`qwen3.5-9b`, `glm-4.5-air`) are in the
registry but **not** in any host's `enabled:` list, so the installer
ignores them. To bring one up ad-hoc, add it to `enabled:` and re-run
`--fix`, or just download manually with
`python scripts/download_models.py --only qwen` and launch via
`launchers/run_qwen.bat`.

On a host with a TTS role enabled, `--fix` also pip-installs
[requirements-tts.txt](requirements-tts.txt) (`chatterbox-tts`, `snac`,
`kokoro-onnx`, `soundfile` — the full set pulls torch, ~2 GB, which is why
it's kept out of the base `requirements.txt` so non-TTS hosts like the Mac
mini stay lean), installs CUDA torch / ONNX Runtime GPU on NVIDIA hosts,
downloads Piper's binary/voices and Kokoro's ONNX assets, and pre-warms the
Chatterbox / SNAC / Piper / Kokoro weights so the first
`/v1/audio/speech` request isn't a cold download. To do it by hand:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-tts.txt
```

Plain check (no changes):

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.install
```

Or open the **🩺 Health & install** panel on the admin webapp's
**🛰 Hub** tab (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`) — same checks, same
fixes, one button per row plus a **Fix-all**.

Requires the `claude` CLI on `PATH` (Claude Code) if any `claude-*`
model is enabled for your host.

Requires the **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`) on `PATH` if you want to use
any `gemini-*` model — install it from
[antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google) and sign in once with
your Google account. `agy` replaces the standalone `gemini` CLI, which
Google deprecates for AI Pro / Ultra subscribers on 2026-06-18. On
Windows the Gemini path also needs `pywinpty` (in `requirements.txt`):
`agy`'s print mode renders to a console, so the hub drives it under a
ConPTY. Without `agy`, requests targeting `gemini-*` return 502 with a
clear "CLI not found" message — the rest of the hub keeps working.

### Machine specs (optional)

[config/machine_specs_example.yaml](config/machine_specs_example.yaml)
documents the hardware schema this hub uses to reason about local
model fit (VRAM, system RAM, GPU compute capability). To populate the
real file for your host, run the detection script:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\detect_machine_specs.py
```

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/detect_machine_specs.py
```

Or copy the example manually and edit it:

```bat
copy config\machine_specs_example.yaml config\machine_specs.yaml
```

`config/machine_specs.yaml` is gitignored. AI coding agents working in
this repo will read it (when present) to recommend model sizes and
quantizations that actually fit your hardware. Optional — the hub
itself runs fine without it.

(macOS / Linux: `./run_hub.sh`, `./launchers/run_all.sh`, etc.)

Once the hub is running, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` for the
admin webapp — six tabs (Hub / Models / Play / OTel / Code / Machines)
covering every operational concern. Going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
redirects there.

### Tray launcher (Windows)

```bat
tray.bat
```

Starts a resident system-tray icon (silent — no terminal window) that:

- Auto-starts the hub on :8000. Hub startup then brings up everything
  configured in **`config/startup_profile.json`** (gitignored live file; see
  the committed **[template](config/startup_profile.example.json)**, issue #304)
  (issue #265) — the same source the admin SPA's Models tab **Startup**
  card reads and writes — for every launch surface (tray, `run_hub.bat`, or
  `python -m src.run_backend hub`): the local model ids listed under
  `models` (default `[qwen35_4b, whisper, whisper_translate,
  whisper_vanilla, piper, orpheus]` — Qwen fast lane, both eager ASR slots
  plus the unbiased-detection whisper-vanilla escape hatch, fast Piper
  speech, and expressive Orpheus speech), Docker + Langfuse if `docker` /
  `langfuse` are `true` (via the same `launch_stack()` the Services card's
  manual launch button uses), and a Mac Mini wake/sync if `mac_mini_sync`
  is `true` (bootstrap if unreachable, sync if reachable but out of date).
  Toggle any item off from the Startup card, or hand-edit the JSON. A fresh
  clone without that file yet falls back to `config/models.yaml`'s legacy
  `tray.autostart_models` list for local models only (no Docker/Langfuse/Mac
  Mini autostart until a profile has been saved once).
- Lets you toggle any other enabled local model on/off from the
  **🧠 Models** submenu (multiple may run concurrently).
- Surfaces the admin webapp via **🚀 Open admin** — same `:8000/admin/`
  URL, opened in your default browser. Live logs, per-backend counters,
  live request stream, sparklines, and a 🩺 health/install panel all
  live there now.
- Surfaces the **local URL**, the **LAN URL**, and (when configured)
  the **Cloudflare tunnel URL** as one-tap clipboard copies — the
  Cloudflare one comes with `?token=<bearer>` appended, so a phone
  loading a fresh tab can hand it back to the SPA without typing.

Drop a shortcut to `tray.bat` in the Windows Startup folder
(`shell:startup`) so the box behaves as an always-on local-LLM
endpoint after login. Routine tray activity is silent; if the tray
ever crashes, a single-shot `tray-crash.log` is written at the repo
root with the traceback (delete it any time — it's only recreated on
the next crash).

### Cloudflare tunnel (optional)

For phone-side access from outside the LAN, run cloudflared with a
named tunnel. The repo ships `webapp/cloudflared.sample.yml` — copy it
to `webapp/cloudflared.yml`, fill in your tunnel UUID + hostname, and
the tray will pick the hostname up automatically and surface
**📋 Copy Cloudflare URL** in its menu. The hub itself doesn't spawn
cloudflared (you own its lifecycle); the tray only *reads* the config.

The admin webapp's bearer token is generated on first tray boot and
persisted to `config/webapp_config.json`. Loopback callers bypass it;
anyone reaching the hub over the tunnel must present
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `?token=…` on the URL.

### Passkey (WebAuthn) gate — parked, server-side only (not planned: #247)

`src/webauthn_gate.py` and `app_web/routers/webauthn.py` implement a
tested, working passkey (WebAuthn) second factor for `/admin` —
registration/authentication ceremonies, a device whitelist, session
tokens — but it is **deliberately unwired**: no enrollment button or
ceremony call anywhere in `app_web/static/`, and the session token
`finish_authentication` mints isn't checked by any request path.
[#247](https://github.com/ferraroroberto/local-llm-hub/issues/247)
scoped building that frontend piece and was closed **not planned**:
`/admin` is only ever reached over loopback or Tailscale, and both
already bypass the bearer-token gate as fully trusted (loopback
outright, Tailscale via `extra_allowlist`) — there's no Cloudflare
tunnel exposure of `/admin` in practice, so a passkey second factor
has no remaining trust boundary left to protect. The code stays in
the tree untouched as a reference implementation in case that trust
model changes later; it isn't a live security feature today.

To poke at it directly anyway: set `webauthn_rp_id` / `webauthn_origin`
in `config/webapp_config.json` (needs the `webauthn` package from
`requirements.txt`; its absence just makes
`GET /admin/api/webauthn/status` report `available: false`), then
drive `POST /admin/api/webauthn/enroll/window` (loopback-only, opens
a 5-minute window) followed by the `/enroll/begin` →
`navigator.credentials.create()` → `/enroll/finish` ceremony from a
WebAuthn-capable browser tab — there's no built-in page for this, so
script it or drive it from devtools. Even fully enrolled, it won't
gate anything.

### Server adoption between launchers

The hub on :8000 (and each per-model port :808x) is single-owner — TCP
allows only one process to bind a port. To make `tray.bat`,
`run_hub.bat`, the per-model `launchers/run_*.bat` scripts, and the
admin SPA's Hub/Models tabs coexist, every launcher follows the same
**adopt-or-spawn** rule:

- If the port is already reachable, the launcher *adopts* the running
  process (no second spawn, no error) and treats it as up.
- Each launcher only stops what it spawned itself. Closing the tray
  doesn't stop a hub that `run_hub.bat` started, and vice versa.
- The admin webapp's **🧠 Models** tab distinguishes managed vs.
  adopted processes and surfaces the foreign PID so you can decide
  whether to take over.

The admin webapp's **🛰 Hub** tab streams the hub log over SSE — even
for an adopted hub, since the log lines come from the *current*
process's in-memory ring rather than a captured stdout. The
Streamlit-era caveat about adopted processes having no log tail no
longer applies.

Equivalent Python entrypoints (run from the project root):

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend hub
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend qwen35_4b
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend gemma4_26b
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend whisper
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend whisper_translate
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend piper
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend chatterbox
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend orpheus

:: Fallback (still enabled, not autostarted)
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend gemma4_e4b

:: Demoted (ad-hoc only; not in tray autostart, not auto-installed)
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend qwen
.venv\Scripts\python -m src.run_backend glm
```

The hub binds on `0.0.0.0:8000`, so other machines on your LAN can
also reach it. The llama-server backends bind on loopback — they're
only reachable through the hub.

## LAN access

The hub binds on `0.0.0.0:8000`, so any machine on the same network
(another laptop, a VM, an agent like openclaw running next to you) can
use it.

1. **Start the hub** (either `run_hub.bat` / `.sh` at the repo root,
   or `tray.bat` on Windows — the tray autostarts the hub). Start any
   local backends you need from `launchers/run_*.bat` or the admin
   webapp's **🧠 Models** tab.
2. **Find your LAN IP.** The admin webapp's **🛰 Hub** tab shows it
   as a clickable **LAN** link. From a terminal:

   ```bat
   ipconfig | findstr IPv4
   ```

3. **First run on Windows:** the firewall will prompt to allow Python
   through. Accept on **Private** networks only — never Public.
4. **Point the remote client at the LAN URL:**

   ```python
   from anthropic import Anthropic
   client = Anthropic(
       api_key="local-dummy",
       base_url="http://192.168.1.42:8000",   # your LAN IP here
   )
   ```

**Security caveats.** There is no authentication — anyone who can reach
the port can spend your Claude quota and burn your GPU. Only run this
on trusted networks (home LAN, office LAN you own). Do **not**
port-forward it to the public internet, and do not accept the firewall
prompt on Public networks (cafés, airports, hotel Wi-Fi).

## Use it from Python

Anthropic SDK, any backend:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="local-dummy", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000")

# Claude via subscription — use the version-free alias, not the dated display_name
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude_haiku",
    max_tokens=128,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

# agentic_light role — Qwen 3.5 4B (hybrid Gated DeltaNet + sparse MoE, full GPU)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="qwen3.5-4b",
    max_tokens=128,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

# agentic_heavy role — Gemma 4 26B MoE (25 B / 3.8 B-active on GPU)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="gemma4-26b-a4b-it",
    max_tokens=128,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
print(msg.content[0].text)

# Or address the role directly — survives future /swap-model rotations
# unchanged. `agentic_light` and `agentic_heavy` both work the same way.
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="agentic_light",
    max_tokens=128,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

# Gemini 3.1 Pro via your Google AI Pro subscription (Antigravity CLI)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="gemini_pro",   # alias for "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)"
    max_tokens=128,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

# Image content blocks work on both subscription paths (claude-* and gemini-*).
# The admin SPA's Play tab grows a file uploader automatically when the
# selected model resolves to a claude/gemini backend.
import base64
with open("photo.png", "rb") as f:
    b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()

msg = client.messages.create(
    model="gemini_pro",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {"type": "image", "source": {
                "type": "base64", "media_type": "image/png", "data": b64,
            }},
        ],
    }],
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
```

> Demoted candidates (`qwen3.5-9b`, `glm-4.5-air`) work the same way
> if you've brought them up ad-hoc — pass their model name as
> `model=`. The hub will return 400 if their backend isn't reachable.

OpenAI SDK (get native tool calls via `llama-server --jinja`):

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="local-dummy", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1")
msg = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemma4-26b-a4b-it",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
print(msg.choices[0].message.content)
```

Raw HTTP:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gemma4-26b-a4b-it","max_tokens":64,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

List enabled models:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models
```

Generate an image (Google Imagen via `agy`) — OpenAI Images shape,
returns `data[].b64_json`:

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="local-dummy", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1")
r = client.images.generate(model="gemini_image", prompt="a red apple on white")
open("apple.png", "wb").write(base64.b64decode(r.data[0].b64_json))
```

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gemini_image","prompt":"a red apple on white"}'
```

Transcribe audio via whisper — through the hub's proxy at
`:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions` (captured in the observability ring) or
directly to `:8090` (lower overhead, shown here):

```bash
# direct to the whisper server (skips the observability ring)
curl -s -F file=@clip.wav -F response_format=json \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/audio/transcriptions

# or through the hub proxy (same shape, lands in the observability ring)
curl -s -F file=@clip.wav -F response_format=json \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions
```

Translate non-English audio to English via the translate slot
(direct to :8091; medium runs eager on CPU, ~1.5 GB RAM):

```bash
# whisper-server honors translate=true (not OpenAI's task=translate) on
# the direct-to-port path; the hub proxy bridges task=translate → translate=true
curl -s -F file=@spanish.wav -F translate=true \
  http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1/audio/transcriptions
```

Or with the OpenAI SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
asr = OpenAI(api_key="local-dummy", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1")
with open("clip.wav", "rb") as f:
    r = asr.audio.transcriptions.create(model="whisper-large-v3-turbo", file=f)
print(r.text)
```

Synthesize speech (text → audio) via the TTS backend — through the hub's
proxy at `:8000/v1/audio/speech` (captured in the observability ring) or
directly to the backend port (lower overhead):

```bash
# through the hub proxy (lands in the observability ring)
# audio_speech → Piper; voice picks amy (default), ryan, ryan-high, or lessac
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"audio_speech","input":"Hey, listen to this.","voice":"amy","response_format":"wav"}' \
  --output reply.wav

# kokoro-tts → Kokoro-82M; empty/default voice uses am_michael
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"kokoro-tts","input":"Arming the perimeter.","voice":"am_michael","response_format":"wav"}' \
  --output kokoro-reply.wav

# Spanish female voice; use em_alex for the male profile
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"kokoro-tts","input":"Hola, esta es una prueba de voz en español.","voice":"ef_dora","response_format":"wav"}' \
  --output kokoro-spanish.wav
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
tts = OpenAI(api_key="local-dummy", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1")
# model="audio_speech" → Piper (auto-loaded); model="orpheus-tts" → Orpheus.
audio = tts.audio.speech.create(model="audio_speech", voice="amy", input="Hey, listen to this.")
audio.stream_to_file("reply.wav")
```

`exaggeration` / `cfg_weight` are Chatterbox's emotion/"tone" dial; `voice`
selects a Piper voice (`amy`, `ryan`, `ryan-high`, `lessac`), an Orpheus preset
(`tara`, `leah`, …), a Kokoro voice id (`am_michael`, `af_bella`,
`am_fenrir`, `ef_dora` (Spanish female), `em_alex` (Spanish male), …), or a Chatterbox cloning clip at
`config/tts_voices/<voice>.wav`. Piper and Kokoro honor `speed` in the
0.5–2.0 range; Chatterbox/Orpheus accept it for API compatibility. Add
`"stream_format":"audio"` to **stream** audio incrementally when the engine
supports it; otherwise the backend returns a single final chunk. The hub
exposes every enabled TTS model on the same route, so a client switches
engines just by changing `model`. Defaults, formats, streaming, voice
cloning, and the Orpheus GGUF caveat are in [docs/add-tts.md](docs/add-tts.md).
An explicit unknown model or voice returns HTTP 400; only omitted fields use
the configured defaults.

The admin Playground lists every configured voice model, marks stopped models,
and filters language and voice choices to the selected engine. It also shows
only controls the engine supports. The language selector is UI metadata: calls
still use the same `model` and `voice` fields as Home Automation, App Launcher,
and WhatsApp Radar.

## Observability (issue #4)

The hub emits OpenTelemetry traces + metrics via OTLP/gRPC into a local
Langfuse stack started by `start_langfuse.bat`. The admin SPA's
**OTel** tab shows stack health, a per-model leaderboard, and a
live trace feed with deep-links into the Langfuse UI for inspection.

Default mode captures raw prompts and completions — fine on a personal
localhost hub, but flip `OTEL_HASH_PROMPTS=true` (in `.env`) any time
the hub binds beyond loopback. `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` turns
telemetry off entirely.

## Coding agent usage (issues #20, #71, #231, #280)

The **Code** tab is a passive, multi-vendor view of host-side coding-agent
activity.  It parses each agent's local session logs server-side — zero
subprocesses, no wrapper around any binary, no impact on the running CLIs:

- **Claude Code** (`vendor="claude"`) — the JSONL transcripts at
  `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` (`src/code_usage.py`).
- **Codex / OpenAI** (`vendor="codex"`) — the rollout JSONL files at
  `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` (`src/codex_usage.py`).  One
  record per `token_count` event, using the per-turn delta `last_token_usage`
  (never the cumulative `total_token_usage`, which would double-count).
- **GitHub Copilot** (`vendor="copilot"`, `src/copilot_usage.py`) — two local
  sources, both carrying **exact** billed AI Credits (not a rate-table
  estimate):
  - The **Copilot CLI**'s `~/.copilot/session-state/<uuid>/events.jsonl`,
    written only for a *clean-shutdown* session — one record per model used
    in that session (session-granular; the CLI doesn't expose a per-turn
    breakdown), priced from the `session.shutdown` event's `totalNanoAiu`
    (`credits = totalNanoAiu / 1e9`).
  - **VS Code Copilot Chat**'s per-session
    `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\<hash>\chatSessions\<uuid>.jsonl`
    event log (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/...`), which
    carries an exact `copilotCredits` float per request plus the resolved
    model — parsed via a minimal replay of the file's patch stream (not a
    general JSON-patch engine, just the couple of fields usage needs).
  Both sources only see sessions that reached this specific machine and
  wrote a complete log — sessions that crashed mid-flight, or ran
  elsewhere, are invisible to them. A separate **"Copilot credits
  (official)" card** (only shown on the Copilot vendor tab) fills that gap
  with the *authoritative* GitHub billing API — per-day × per-model spend,
  no session/project attribution, requires a `GITHUB_COPILOT_BILLING_PAT`
  fine-grained PAT (`.env`, "Plan: read-only" permission) or the card shows
  "not configured" rather than erroring (`src/copilot_billing.py`,
  `GET /admin/api/code/copilot/billing`).
- **AGY / Antigravity** (`vendor="agy"`, `src/agentsview_usage.py`) — sourced
  from the optional external
  [AgentsView](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview) service, which indexes
  `agy`'s local session storage the hub declined to reverse-engineer itself
  (#72/#279). Merges AgentsView's `gemini` (hub-routed calls) and
  `antigravity-cli` (interactive) slugs into one AGY vendor; other agents
  AgentsView knows about are deliberately not surfaced (curated map in
  `agentsview_usage.py`). Polled over HTTP, never from raw files; the hub
  runs fully without it. AgentsView appears in the Hub tab's **Services**
  card and the Models tab's **Startup** toggles — the hub launches it at
  startup when toggled on (exe from `.venv-agentsview/`, `AGENTSVIEW_EXE`,
  or PATH). Setup and behaviour:
  [docs/code-usage-agentsview.md](docs/code-usage-agentsview.md).

A **vendor selector** (All / Claude / Codex / Copilot / AGY) sits above the
period toggle.
**All** sums every vendor into the headline counters and ≈ $ costs and shows a
**Per-vendor** breakdown table; picking a single vendor scopes the whole panel
to it.  The requests tile also shows the grand-total ≈ $ cost.  Counters and
per-model / per-project breakdowns also toggle between **Day / Week / Month /
All**, each with a delta badge (green ↑ / red ↓) vs. the previous comparable
period — or a "new" badge when a metric had no activity in the prior window
(e.g. a vendor used for the first time this period).

In the per-project table, projects under the `automation` workspace are shown by
folder name (the `automation-` prefix is stripped; the workspace root itself
stays `automation`), and long names are truncated with “…” to keep the table
readable on mobile — hover for the full path.

The input, output, and cache-read tiles show an **≈ $… equivalent API cost**
(issue #52) — what those tokens would have billed on the metered API, priced
per model from `config/claude_pricing.json` (Anthropic) and
`config/openai_pricing.json` (OpenAI); refresh those files when a provider
changes prices.  Codex usage is subscription-metered, so the ≈ $ figure is an
*estimate* against OpenAI list prices.  **Copilot and AgentsView-sourced
vendors are the exceptions:** Copilot's cost figure is the session/VS-Code
log's own exact `credits_usd`, and AgentsView vendors carry the cost
*as reported by AgentsView* (its own estimate for subscription agents) —
neither is re-priced against the hub's rate tables, even when the underlying
model resolves to a Claude model.

Two cross-vendor token semantics to keep in mind: for **Codex**, `cached_input`
tokens are a *subset* of input (the cost path prices the non-cached remainder at
the input rate and the cached portion at the cheaper cached rate), and
`reasoning_output_tokens` are a *subset* of output — surfaced as an "incl. …
reasoning" sub-note under the output tile, never added on top.  Claude's
`cache_read` tokens, by contrast, are reported separately/additively.  The
OpenAI >272K long-context surcharge (2× input / 1.5× output) is not modelled.

A **Usage trend** card (issue #50) sits below the breakdowns with four stacked
area charts — input tokens, output tokens, requests, and cache reads — with one
coloured series per model: the Claude families (Haiku / Sonnet / Opus) keep
fixed colours, and every other model (e.g. Codex `GPT-5.5`) gets its own series
colour; only an unattributable model id falls into a grey "Other" band.  Day →
last 14 days; Week → last 12 weeks; Month → last 12 months; All → charts hidden.  A "Recent sessions" list shows the last 15
sessions across every project on this host.

> **⚠️ The local JSONL source undercounts Claude two ways (verified 2026-07-12, #280).** (a) Sessions bridged through **claude.ai/code** (web/desktop remote-control) write `mode`/`permission` lines but **no assistant/usage records** to the local transcripts — their tokens are only visible via the **OTel tab**'s "Claude Code (host CLI)" panel (issue #68): the hub runs its own OTLP-metrics receiver (`POST /v1/metrics`) that Claude Code's telemetry export can point at; see [docs/telemetry-langfuse.md](docs/telemetry-langfuse.md#claude-code-otel-metrics-receiver-issue-68) for the host env vars. (b) Claude Code **prunes transcripts after ~30 days** (`cleanupPeriodDays`) — to survive that, the hub snapshots daily rollups per (date, vendor, model, project) into `data/code_usage_history.json` (`src/code_usage_history.py`: max-merge on write, per-vendor cutoff on read so no day is double-counted) and feeds them back into the "All" period after the source files are gone. History accumulates from 2026-07-12 forward; days already pruned before then are unrecoverable from disk. On the plus side, newer Claude Code also writes per-session directories with **sub-agent transcripts** (`projects/<proj>/<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`), which the parser now includes — the old sub-agent blind spot is captured where those exist; finer per-subagent attribution is tracked upstream in [anthropics/claude-code#22625](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22625).

## Test

Unit tests (fast, no real `claude` / GPU calls):

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
```

End-to-end smoke test (requires hub + whichever backends you care
about running):

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\smoke_test.py
```

It iterates every enabled model from the registry, skips backends
whose port isn't reachable, and reports per-model pass/fail.

## Limitations (intentional — lightweight)

- **Partial streaming.** `POST /v1/chat/completions` with
  `stream: true` is fully supported for local backends — the hub
  proxies llama-server's SSE through, scrubbing `<think>...</think>`
  blocks from reasoning models (qwen / glm) so OpenAI-shape clients
  see only the final answer. The Anthropic-shape `POST /v1/messages`
  still returns a single JSON object when `stream: true` (Anthropic
  event translation is on the backlog below).
- Multi-turn chats are flattened into a single prompt for `claude -p`.
  (The local backends handle multi-turn natively through llama-server.)
- Tool-use translation across Anthropic ↔ OpenAI shapes is not
  implemented for qwen/glm. OpenAI-shape callers get native tool calls
  from llama-server's `--jinja` templates; Anthropic-shape callers to
  qwen/glm are text-only for now. Claude tool use passes through
  unchanged.
- **Image and document content blocks are supported on the `claude-*`
  and `gemini-*` subscription paths** — the hub base64-decodes each
  `image` / `document` block to a per-request temp dir, adds that dir to
  the CLI workspace (`claude --add-dir` / `agy --add-dir`) and references
  the files inline (`@<basename>` for `agy`). Adding the dir to the
  workspace is what makes `agy` resolve the reference deterministically
  instead of searching the filesystem (which read attachments only
  intermittently — issue #63). `document`
  blocks accept any file the CLI can read: PDF, plus text/data/code
  files (JSON, CSV, Markdown, …); the `media_type` picks the temp-file
  extension and unknown types fall back to `.bin` (still read as bytes).
  Local `llama-server` backends (`qwen3.5-*`, `gemma4-*`) are text-only
  and return 400 with a hint to retry on a subscription model. URL
  sources degrade to a text reference (not fetched). Extended-thinking
  blocks are still dropped at the shape boundary.
- Token counts reflect what each backend reports in its response. The
  `agy` CLI does not surface token counts, so usage on the `gemini-*`
  path is reported as zero.
- **Gemini calls are serialized.** `agy` selects its model from global
  persisted state, so the hub holds a lock across the model switch and
  the print call. Concurrent `gemini-*` requests run one at a time;
  switching model between calls adds a one-time interactive step.
- **The `agy` attachment path can only be verified locally.** GitHub CI (`windows-latest`) has no authenticated `agy` / Gemini subscription. `tests/test_gemini_attachments_live.py` is the live regression guard for the `--add-dir` fix from #63 — it is skipped by default and must be run manually on the Windows reference box after any change to `src/gemini_cli.py`'s attachment handling: `$env:HUB_LIVE_GEMINI = "1"; .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_gemini_attachments_live.py -v`.

## Backlog for improvement

Ordered roughly by payoff for API parity / developer experience.

**High value — closes real compatibility gaps**

- **Streaming (SSE) on `/v1/messages`.** OpenAI-shape streaming on
  `/v1/chat/completions` already lands.
  Still missing: map `claude -p --output-format stream-json` and
  llama-server's native SSE onto the Anthropic event shape
  (`message_start`, `content_block_delta`, `message_delta`,
  `message_stop`) so `client.messages.stream(...)` works unchanged.
- **Tool-use round-trips for qwen/glm on the Anthropic shape.** Accept
  `tools` + emit `tool_use`/`tool_result` content blocks, translating
  against llama-server's OpenAI-function-calling output.
- **Anthropic-shaped error responses.** Match
  `{"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"..."}}`
  with the right status codes, so the SDK's retry / typed-exception
  logic behaves as it would against the real API.
- **Auth + version headers.** Accept and echo `x-api-key`,
  `anthropic-version`, `anthropic-beta` so clients that inspect them
  aren't surprised.
- **`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`.** Useful for cost estimation;
  could shell out to a dry-run or use a tokenizer locally.
- **Request IDs.** Add `request-id` / `x-request-id` and thread them
  into logs for traceability.
- **CORS.** Enable it so browser-based clients and local webapps can
  call the hub directly.
- **OpenAI-shape document input.** Anthropic-shape `document` blocks (PDF
  and text/data files) already land on the `claude-*` / `gemini-*` paths —
  see Limitations above. Still missing: document input on the OpenAI-shape
  `/v1/chat/completions` route, which would reuse the same
  decode-and-`--add-dir` plumbing.
- **Multimodal local backends.** Image blocks work on the cloud routes
  (`claude-*`, `gemini-*`); local routing is text-only until a
  multimodal llama-server build (qwen-VL, gemma-vision) is wired in.

**Medium value — fidelity and ergonomics**

- **Faithful multi-turn via `claude -p --input-format stream-json`.**
  Preserves prior assistant turns as real assistant messages rather
  than flattening. Better cache reuse.
- **`stop_sequences`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k` passthrough** to
  every backend. Some the CLI supports, others must be documented as
  no-ops.
- **Stop-reason mapping.** Normalize CLI + llama-server stop reasons
  onto the Anthropic enum.
- **Persistent sessions via `--resume`.** Optional `session_id` in
  request metadata → reuse a CLI session for stateful chat with
  proper prompt-cache hits.
- **Metadata passthrough.** Log `metadata.user_id` and tie to request
  IDs for per-user observability.
- **Concurrency / process pooling for Claude.** Each request spawns a
  subprocess (~1–2 s overhead). A small warm pool or `--resume` reuse
  cuts p50 latency significantly.
- **Extended thinking blocks** (`thinking: {type:"enabled", budget_tokens}`)
  on the Claude path.
- **MLX backend for the Mac mini.** llama.cpp-Metal works; MLX is
  30–50 % faster for dense 9 B. Add as a new `backend: "mlx"` entry in
  the registry with a sibling to `openai_upstream.py`.

**Low value — nice-to-have**

- **`/v1/messages/batches`** (batch API).
- **Prompt-cache-control honoring** on system/message blocks.
- **Rate-limit response headers** (`anthropic-ratelimit-*`).
- **Auto-start enabled backends with the hub.** Deliberately not done
  today so a 60 GB RAM model doesn't load when someone only wants
  Claude.
