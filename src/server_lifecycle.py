"""FastAPI startup/shutdown lifecycle wiring + the background resource
sampler for the hub app.

Extracted out of ``server.py`` (issue #198) — that module's own docstring
already flagged ``/v1/images/*`` and ``/v1/audio/*`` as prior splits for
exactly this reason (keeping the god-module from growing further); the
startup/shutdown event bodies and the 2s-tick resource sampler were the
next-largest chunk still living inline, mixed in with route registration.

``server.py`` wires these on with ``app.add_event_handler(...)`` (the
non-decorator form of ``@app.on_event``) rather than decorating them here,
so the functions stay plain, directly-callable, and directly-testable —
``tests/test_restart_keepalive.py`` calls ``stop_backend_children()``
straight, with no FastAPI app in the loop.
