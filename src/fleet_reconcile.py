"""Fleet reconcile — converge each host to its desired placement (#353).

Step 2 of the always-on control plane. Reads ``config/fleet_placement.json``
(``src/fleet_placement.py``) and, for every host with placed models, makes the
live fleet match intent:

  * an **unreachable** satellite that ``can_ssh`` → wake it via
    ``remote_bootstrap.bootstrap_host`` (the tower holds the forced-command
    key); once it answers, converge it in the same pass;
  * a **reachable remote** host → write its ``startup_profile`` through to the
    desired set (so it self-boots correctly on its *own* next reboot, via
    Step 1's host-addressable profile API) and start any placed model not up;
  * the **local** (control-node) host → start its placed models via
    ``backend_process.start`` directly.

The periodic pass (:func:`reconcile_once`) is **additive**: it starts missing
placed models but never stops one that was started by hand and isn't placed.
Explicit un-placement is a separate, deliberate action
(:func:`apply_placement_change`, driven by the placement API's PATCH) — it stops
the removed models and drops them from the host's profile.

Everything leans on existing idempotency: ``backend_process.start`` adopts a
reachable port and no-ops if already running, and a forwarded ``/start`` returns
409 "already running" — both treated as success here — so the loop is safe to
run every few minutes forever. Framework-free (raw ``httpx`` peer calls,
soft-failing dicts) exactly like ``remote_bootstrap``, so it stays unit-testable
with no FastAPI app in the loop.
