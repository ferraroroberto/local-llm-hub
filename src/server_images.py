"""Image generation + edit routes (OpenAI ``/v1/images/*`` shape).

Split out of ``server.py`` so the routing/chat core stays readable. Both routes
guard on a row flagged ``image_gen`` and 400 everything else.

Two image backends exist, and ``/v1/images/generations`` dispatches on
``model.backend``:

* ``gemini`` — Google's Imagen, driven through the Antigravity CLI's agentic
  tool harness (there is no Nano Banana picker model — issue #114). A
  subscription path with no local process.
* ``comfyui`` — FLUX.1 [dev] on this host's own GPU (#492). An ordinary
  ``models.yaml`` backend process, so it goes through the on-demand lifecycle
  (#422): the first request spawns ComfyUI and waits for it, and the idle
  watchdog unloads it again.

``/v1/images/edits`` stays **gemini-only** — editing on the ComfyUI path needs a
different workflow graph (img2img/inpaint) and is deliberately out of #492's
scope.

The routes are collected on a module-level :class:`fastapi.APIRouter` and
mounted onto the parent hub app by ``server.py`` via ``include_router``.
