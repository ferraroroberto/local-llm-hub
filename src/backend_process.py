"""Per-model backend process manager.

Each enabled local model in the registry gets its own singleton process +
per-backend log file (``data/logs/backend-<id>.log``) here. Keyed by model
id ("qwen", "glm", "whisper"). Used by the admin SPA's Models tab, the
tray, and the per-model launcher scripts to start/stop individual backends
and tail their output without global-state entanglement. The log file is
written by the child (not a hub-owned pipe), so it stays readable across a
hub restart and an inherited backend never writes into a closed pipe.

Two engine families share this manager:
  - `llama-server` for chat/completion GGUF models (qwen, glm, gemma4*)
  - `whisper-server` for whisper.cpp ASR (OpenAI-compatible /v1/audio/*)
The shape differences (binary location, -m vs --model flag, health
endpoint) are absorbed in `build_command` and `is_reachable`.

Ownership semantics mirror :mod:`src.server_process` — see its module
docstring. ``start(model_id)`` adopts an already-reachable backend on
the model's port instead of spawning a duplicate; ``stop(model_id)``
only stops what we spawned. Use :func:`force_stop_external` to reclaim
a port held by someone else.
