"""ComfyUI client — drives the local FLUX image backend (#492).

The hub's other image path (``gemini_cli.call_gemini_image``) shells out to the
Antigravity CLI and scrapes whatever artifact the agent leaves on disk. This one
is an ordinary HTTP client: ComfyUI runs as a normal ``models.yaml`` backend
process (``engine: comfyui-server``) and exposes a documented prompt API.

Three calls make a generation:

1. ``POST /prompt`` with a **workflow graph** in ComfyUI's "API format" —
   ``{node_id: {"class_type": ..., "inputs": {...}}}``, where an input wired to
   another node is the pair ``[node_id, output_index]``. Returns a
   ``prompt_id``.
2. ``GET /history/<prompt_id>`` — empty ``{}`` while the job is queued or
   running, then the finished record with its ``outputs`` and ``status``.
3. ``GET /view?filename=…&subfolder=…&type=…`` — the image bytes.

:func:`build_flux_workflow` writes the graph for FLUX.1 [dev]. Two details there
are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

* **``EmptySD3LatentImage``, not ``EmptyLatentImage``** — FLUX uses a 16-channel
  latent. The SD-era node emits 4 channels and the sampler produces noise.
* **``cfg: 1.0`` plus a ``FluxGuidance`` node.** FLUX [dev] is
  guidance-*distilled*: real CFG is a no-op that merely doubles the work, and
  the guidance scale is instead injected into the conditioning. The negative
  prompt is wired only because ``KSampler`` requires the input.

Output uses ``PreviewImage`` (ComfyUI's ``temp`` type) rather than
``SaveImage``. The hub returns the bytes to the caller and has no reason to keep
a copy; ``temp`` is cleared by ComfyUI on startup, so the on-demand
load/idle-unload cycle (#422) garbage-collects generations for free instead of
growing an unbounded output directory nobody prunes.

    FLUX.2 ships the transformer, its text encoder and the VAE as three
    separate files, so there is no ``CheckpointLoaderSimple`` to yield all
    three edges. Which encoder depends on the variant — Mistral-Small-24B for
    [dev], Qwen3-4B for [klein] — and they are **not** interchangeable; the
    caller supplies the right one via ``clip_name``. It also needs
    FLUX.2-specific nodes, confirmed against a live ``/object_info`` rather
    than assumed:

    * ``EmptyFlux2LatentImage`` — its own latent shape.
    * ``Flux2Scheduler`` — a **resolution-aware** sigma schedule taking width
      and height, which is why the plain ``KSampler`` path cannot be reused.
    * ``SamplerCustomAdvanced`` + ``BasicGuider`` — the guider carries a single
      conditioning, matching a guidance-distilled model, instead of KSampler's
      positive/negative pair with a CFG that would be a no-op.

    The transformer loads through the stock ``UNETLoader``. #498 also carried a
    ``UnetLoaderGGUF`` branch for the quantized 32B [dev] transformer, dropped
    with that row in #501 — see ``config/models.yaml``. Re-adding a ``.gguf``
    model means restoring both the loader branch and the ComfyUI-GGUF custom
    node, since stock ComfyUI cannot read that format at all.
