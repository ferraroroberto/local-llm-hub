# Frontier local findings — candidates tested on this box

Deterministic run-over-run memory for `/frontier-refresh` (#277). Published
numbers said one thing, a local measurement said another — this file is where
that learning survives, so the same candidate is never re-proposed and
re-disproven in a loop.

**Contract with the skill** (`.claude/skills/frontier-refresh/SKILL.md`):

- The skill reads this file in step 1, before computing verdicts.
- A role whose best alternative matches an **unresolved** entry here gets
  verdict `watch` with reason `disproven locally <date> (#N)` — never
  `upgrade` / `runtime_upgrade` — unless the entry's **re-open trigger** is
  demonstrably met (cite the evidence in the report if so).
- `watch` is not actionable, so step 8 files no issue for it: no repeat work.
- Whoever disproves (or re-proves) a candidate locally appends/updates the
  entry **in the same PR** as the disproof — same anti-staleness contract as
  `.fleet.toml`.

Entries are append-only; when a re-open trigger fires and the candidate is
re-tested, update its **Status** line instead of deleting history.

## 2026-07-12 — faster-whisper (CTranslate2) for `audio_transcribe` — DISPROVEN

- **Candidate:** faster-whisper 1.2.1 / CTranslate2 4.8.1, `large-v3-turbo`
  CT2 weights, int8_float16 and float16, RTX 5060 Ti.
- **Verdict it disproves:** `runtime_upgrade` (carried 2026-05-10 and
  2026-07-12, report §7.3 — "~2× RTFx, lower VRAM, same quality").
- **Measured:** speedup is **1.0×**, not 2× — aggregate RTFx 33.4 vs 33.6
  (int8) and 32.6 vs 33.3 (fp16) over 556 s of real dictation audio;
  whisper.cpp v1.8.6 cuBLAS is already ~33× real-time on this GPU. WER
  parity-to-worse (3.9 % vs 4.4 % int8; 3.7 % vs 5.4 % fp16). **Drops the
  leading "Claude Code" wake phrase 0/2 vs whisper.cpp's 2/2** across an
  18-attempt decode sweep (beam/greedy, patience, VAD, hotwords,
  initial_prompt, thresholds × both compute types); audio-head loss ruled
  out. Same decoder-side failure that kept Parakeet off the default role
  (#138).
- **Record:** [#274 closing comment](https://github.com/ferraroroberto/local-llm-hub/issues/274#issuecomment-4949098008)
  (full method + per-clip table); corpus: `.scratch/parakeet-bench/` clips +
  refs, harness `.scratch/fw-bench/`.
- **Re-open trigger:** a faster-whisper/CTranslate2 release that demonstrably
  fixes leading-phrase recall, or hardware where whisper.cpp no longer holds
  speed parity — then re-measure on the same corpus before any verdict
  upgrade.
- **Status:** unresolved (verdict stays `watch`).
