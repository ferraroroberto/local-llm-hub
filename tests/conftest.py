    ``run_until_complete`` frame stays alive on the OS thread for the whole
    life of the session-scoped ``playwright``/``browser`` fixtures — so
    ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` keeps returning that loop on the main
    thread for the rest of the *process*, not just for the duration of one
    e2e test. Any later test that reaches for a bare ``asyncio.run(...)``

    ``pytest.ini`` deliberately collects, e2e included, so a bare invocation
    or an IDE runner works — shares one process, and ``tests/e2e`` sorts
    *first* alphabetically ("e2e" < "test_..."), so it always ran ahead of
    the affected files. Moving every ``tests/e2e`` item after every other
    item removes the hazard without touching Playwright or any affected
    test's ``asyncio.run()`` call site: nothing async-driven runs after
