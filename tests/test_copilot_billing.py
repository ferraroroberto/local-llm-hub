"""Regression test for the copilot_billing UTC-midnight cache gap (#529).

`get_daily_credits` caches each day's usage; "today" (still accruing) is
refreshed on a short TTL while past days are meant to be cached forever
*once immutable*. The bug: the cache-forever check was gated purely on
`d == today` at call time, so a day cached while it was still "today" (in
its final `_TODAY_REFRESH_SECS` window before UTC midnight) was never
re-fetched once the date rolled over -- any late spend in that window was
permanently dropped. The fix stamps each entry `settled` and forces exactly
one re-fetch the first time a not-yet-settled day is seen as no longer
"today".
