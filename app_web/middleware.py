"""Bearer-token middleware for the /admin sub-app.

Loopback callers (PC itself) bypass the bearer token. Non-loopback
callers must present ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``, ``x-api-key:
<token>`` (the Anthropic SDK's own credential header, #461), or
``?token=…`` on the URL (the last is what bookmarked / shared
URLs use; the SPA strips it from ``window.location`` on first load).

WebSocket handshakes are not seen by this middleware:
``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` only ever runs for ``http``-scope connections, so
a ``@router.websocket(...)`` route gets no coverage from it at all. Any
websocket route must therefore call :func:`authorize_websocket`
explicitly before ``accept()`` — the middleware cannot do it for you.
Most live-ops streams use SSE (plain HTTP, covered here); the Machines
tab's terminal proxy is the one websocket route, and it calls the guard.

The loopback and allowlist bypasses trust a caller for *where it connected
from*. A page served from off this machine can borrow those positions by having
the user's browser make the request, so a request whose ``Origin`` is not local
is held to the token instead — see :func:`_is_foreign_origin_request`, which
draws that line with `src/cors_policy.py`'s own definition of a local origin.
